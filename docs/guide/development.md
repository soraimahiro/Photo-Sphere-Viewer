# Development

Photo Sphere Viewer is developped in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
The repository is a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) mono-repo containing the core package as well as official adapters and plugins.
The building process is based on [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) (toolkit based on esbuild) with a bunch of customizations.
The documentation is created with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).
Files are linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).
Tests are executed with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
You will need [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/).
